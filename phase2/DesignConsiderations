Some Design Patterns implemented:
1. Factory: Used to create the appropriate type of User in the User package
2. Strategy: Comparable was implemented for Events to sort the events in a date-time order for the EventProgramExport (events.html)


Other design choices:
1. An implementation for the UserManager, which uses a Map object to store the aggregate list of users and creates
   LinkedLists for users of specific types>
2. Makes use of the MVP model, with a central Presenter-handling all interactions with each of the package controllers,
   and passes that information on to the GUI.
3. Serializable: Used to save events to a file for persistent data storage.
       Used in the Event package and User package
4. Polymorphism for Event (Abstract parent class) so use case (EventManager) can work on all types of events
5. Polymorphism for User (Abstract parent class)
6. Abstraction: the use of the Conversation interface in the Message Package so that the Broadcast and Chatroom shared
                functionality is shared with the user, but the implementation is not.
