Some Design Patterns implemented:
1. Serializable: Used to save events to a file for persistent data storage.
    Used in the Event package and User package
2. Comparable: (In event package not sure if it is used)
3. Factory: Used to create the appropriate type of User in the User package

Other design choices:
1. An implementation for the UserManager, which uses a Map object to store the aggregate list of users and creates
   LinkedLists for users of specific types> (TODO: Maybe justify usage of Map?)
2. Makes use of the MVP model, with a central Presenter-handling all interactions with each of the package controllers,
   and passes that information on to the GUI.
3.
